function based component -> These are simply JavaScript functions that return JSX (the UI).
it is static type, it means it does not shows any changes.
Key Features : 
Simpler syntax.
Use React Hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) to manage state and lifecycle.
Recommended for modern React development.

class based component -> These are ES6 classes that extend React.Component.
it is dynamic type, it means when we change anythink inside the code so this shows wffects inside the user interface.
Key Features :
Have access to lifecycle methods (componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, etc.).
Use this.state and this.setState() for state management.
More verbose syntax.
Still supported, but not preferred for new projects.



JSX -> JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension used in React that lets you write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.
It makes writing UI components easier and more readable.
key Points : 
JSX looks like HTML, but it's actually JavaScript.
You can embed JavaScript in JSX using {}.
You must use className instead of class, and htmlFor instead of for.
JSX must return one root element.
